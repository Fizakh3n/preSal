🚀 Exciting Journey into Predictive Modeling with 'preSal'!! 🎉<br>
•I’m thrilled to share my first-ever model deployment project, preSal, where I developed a predictive model to determine salary levels using a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This journey has been an enriching experience filled with learning and innovation. 🛠️⚒️<br>
<br>
<br>
Here’s a breakdown of my process:<br>
<br>
🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation🧹⚙️<br>
•I started with a comprehensive salary dataset that required meticulous cleaning. This involved handling missing values, encoding categorical features using Label Encoding, and ensuring compatibility with the models I planned to use. <br>
<br>
📊 Model Benchmarking🎰<br>
•Next, I conducted model benchmarking to compare the performance of several algorithms, including:<br>
→Logistic Regression<br>
→Random Forest<br>
→XGBoost<br>
•This process allowed me to understand each model’s strengths and weaknesses. I evaluated their performance based on accuracy and selected the best candidates for further refinement.<br>
<br>
⚙️ Hyperparameter Tuning<br>
•To enhance the model's performance, I employed hyperparameter tuning. Using techniques like GridSearchCV, I was able to identify the optimal parameters for the Random Forest model, which significantly improved its accuracy.<br>

💾 Saving Models with Pickle<br>
•Once I settled on the best-performing model, I utilized Pickle to save and load my trained models efficiently. This step ensures that I can reuse my models without retraining them each time.<br>

•🌐 Frontend Development with HTML<br>
With the model ready, I turned my attention to creating a user-friendly interface. I wrote HTML code to design a simple yet effective frontend where users can input features for salary prediction.<br>

🖥️ Model Deployment using Flask<br>
•The final touch was deploying the model using Flask, a micro web framework. This allowed me to integrate my backend model with the frontend seamlessly, enabling real-time predictions through a web application.<br>

🔗 The Result?<br>
•The culmination of this project is a functional web application where users can enter their data and receive salary predictions based on the model’s insights. It's a proud moment to see my model in action!<br>

I’m grateful for the journey and all the resources I leveraged along the way. This project has not only deepened my understanding of machine learning and deployment but has also ignited my passion for data science.<br>

💡 Key Takeaways:<br>
•Always clean and prepare your data thoroughly.<br>
Model benchmarking and hyperparameter tuning are vital for optimal performance.<br>

Flask simplifies the process of deploying machine learning models.<br>
📈 Looking Ahead<br>
•I’m excited to continue exploring the field of data science and machine learning. I look forward to sharing more projects in the future!<br>
